- 👋 Hi, I’m @mx-ruthie
- 👀 I’m interested in a full-time career coding, tarot, queer issues, and the possum I feed that lives under my porch. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the full PERN stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me break into a career in the field, also making a cool tarot project. 
- 📫 How to reach me: ruth.diane.irvin@gmail.com
